**Goal:** $goal

## Error Analysis

## Files to Fix

Use your Write or Edit tools to modify these files:

$files_to_modify

$additional_instructions_section

## Your Task

1. Analyze all errors above (validation errors AND test failures)
2. Identify root causes of each issue
3. Fix the implementation using your Write/Edit tools
4. Ensure all artifact signatures match the manifest exactly
5. Run validation commands to verify all issues are resolved

The fixes should:
- Address ALL validation errors and test failures
- Match all artifact signatures from the manifest exactly
- Handle errors appropriately (don't crash on invalid input)
- Follow Python conventions (PEP 8, type hints, docstrings)
- Fix root causes, not just symptoms



Please fix the code now.


CRITICAL: Use your file editing tools to directly write/update the files listed above.

- Fix all issues in the implementation code
- Make all changes directly using your file editing capabilities  
- Do not just show the code - actually fix the files
- Ensure all validation errors and test failures are resolved
- Ensure the code matches all artifact signatures exactly
