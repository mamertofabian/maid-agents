## Your Task

1. **Review the manifest and test files** for architectural quality
2. **Evaluate:**
   - Goal clarity and achievability
   - Test coverage and meaningfulness
   - Artifact design and separation of concerns
   - MAID compliance and best practices
3. **Make improvements ONLY if architectural issues are found**
4. **Provide detailed feedback** on the plan quality

Focus on architecture and design, not implementation details. The plan should be:
- **Clear**: Goal and artifacts are well-defined
- **Testable**: Tests comprehensively verify the contract
- **Isolated**: Properly scoped and self-contained
- **Sound**: Well-architected with proper separation of concerns

If the plan is architecturally sound, approve it without changes. If issues are found, fix them using your Edit tool.

Provide your review in the format specified in the system prompt.
